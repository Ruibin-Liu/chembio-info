Get chemistry and biology information in an easy and quick way

## Why? To save time and avoid overkilling

There are many cheminformatics and bioinformatics tools to get public chemistry and biology information. They have been tested and used widely in many projects, but they are usually overkill. For many researchers out of a specific field, it's also not worthwhile to dive into their long and sometimes hard to understand mannuals or turotials, or those tools have many/complex dependencies to install. This repository is a place for simple python/bash scripts to get the exact chemistry and biology information that is available publicly.

## Rules

1. Only python and bash scripts

2. No dependency on python or bash version

3. Always try to use built-in python functions and bash tools

4. Easy to understand and modify for personal purposes

## Usage

Copy-paste/download the specific script and run with `bash SCRIPTNAME` or  `python SCRIPTNAME`.
